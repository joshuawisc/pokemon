# Pokeball Question

According to [Bulbapedia][1] the size of a Pokeball switches between that of a baseball or a ping pong ball by pressing a button. My calculations will be under the assumption that the pokeballs are full sized.

Diameter of Pokeball = 75*mm* [(From Wikipedia)][2]

Volume of Pokeball = 2.21 * 10<sup>-4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> (vol. of sphere)

Height of Coit Tower = 64*m* [(From skyscrapercenter.com)][3]

Diameter of Tower ~= 11*m* (measured from Google Maps)

Volume of Tower = 6082.12 m<sup>3</sup> (vol. of cylinder)

The Pokeballs are packed in a HCP lattice to produce highest average density of 74% of total volume [(From Wikipedia)][4]

74% of Volume of Tower = 0.74 * 6082.12 = 4500.77 m<sup>3</sup>

Amount of Pokeballs = Total volume occupied by balls / Volume per ball</br>
                    = 4500.77 / 2.21 * 10^-4 m<sup>3</sup></br>
                    = 20,365,475 Pokeballs

### ANSWER = 20,365,475 Pokeballs
